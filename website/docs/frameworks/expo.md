# Expo

If you are using Expo with a framework (Next.js, Gatsy, Storybook, etc), please follow their respective guides.

Otherwise you can setup Expo by using Babel or the Tailwind CLI

- [Babel](../compilation/babel.md)
- [Babel (Compile Only)](../compilation/babel-compile-only.md)
- [Tailwind CLI](../compilation/cli-native.md)
