# Solito

Solito apps are a combination of `react-native` (either vanilla or Expo) and `Next.js`. Because `Next.js 12+` uses `swc` for compilation, you may decide not to use the `babel` versions of `tailwindcss-react-native`.

## Using the `swc` compiler

- **Native**: [Native w/ compile only](/setup-guides/native-compile-only)
- **Next.JS**: [NextJS w/ swc](/setup-guides/nextjs)

## Using the `babel` compiler

You will need to follow the [Full Babel](/setup-guides/full-babel) instuctions for both your `react-native` and `Next.js` applications.
