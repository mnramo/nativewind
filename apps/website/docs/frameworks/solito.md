# Solito

Solito apps are typically a monorepo containing both `react-native` (either vanilla or Expo) and `Next.js` application. You will need to setup each app individually.

We recommend

- Native: follow the [native Babel setup](../native/babel.mdx)
- Next.js: follow the [Next.js setup](../frameworks/nextjs.md)
