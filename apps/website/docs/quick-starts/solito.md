# Solito

A Solito project is typically two separate applications that share a monorepo (typically an Expo and a Next.js application)

You will need setup each project individually. We recommend using the [Babel](../guides/babel) for your native app and [Next.js via Babel](./nextjs) for your Next.js app.
